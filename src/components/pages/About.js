      <p>
        I worked in manfacturing pop cans for 15 years. It was one of the best
        jobs I have ever had. I loved trouble shooting machines. Finding a way
        to get them to run was my favorite part of the job. I think thats why I
        have enjoyed computer programing so much. I feel like programming is the
        best puzzle ever. There is always something to learn and improve one in
        your coding.
